A basic android calculator made for learning purposes.
Fork, clone and use for your own learning purposes if wanted.
Use with caution.

#IDEAS:
New textview to see the current algorithm with an erase button for latest input.
Remake so several operators is possible.
Adding new functions, like parentheses.

#VERSIONUPDATE:

version 1.2
All operators work. Basic calculations. No nested algorithms is possible yet.

version 1.1
Addition works. Ugly way to calculate. Going to be fixed in next update.

Version 1.0
Buttons, textview and onclick function working.
